# Contributing to Bearnie

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Bearnie! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## AI-Generated Pull Requests

We do not accept pull requests that are fully generated by AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) without meaningful human review and understanding.

**Why?**
- We value contributions from people who understand the codebase
- AI-generated code often lacks context and can introduce subtle bugs
- We want contributors to learn and grow, not just copy-paste AI output

**What's acceptable:**
- Using AI as a coding assistant while you write and understand the code
- AI-assisted code that you've reviewed, tested, and can explain

**What's not acceptable:**
- Submitting AI-generated PRs without understanding the changes
- Using AI bots to automatically create issues or PRs

PRs that appear to be fully AI-generated without human oversight will be closed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Git
- Basic familiarity with Astro and Tailwind CSS

### Local Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bearnie.git
cd bearnie
npm install
```

2. **Create a feature branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

4. **Build the CLI locally**

```bash
npm run cli:build
npm run cli:link
```

Now you can test the CLI with `bearnie` command.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the issue already exists in [Issues](https://github.com/michael-andreuzza/bearnie/issues)
2. Provide a clear, descriptive title
3. Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem
4. Explain what you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
5. Include screenshots or error messages if applicable

**Example:**

```
Title: Button component doesn't apply variant styles

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add button component: npx bearnie add button
2. Use <Button variant="destructive">Delete</Button>
3. The button appears with default styling, not destructive

Expected: Destructive red styling should be applied
Actual: Button has default blue styling
```

### Submitting Features

1. Open an issue with the tag `enhancement`
2. Describe the feature and why it would be useful
3. Provide examples if applicable
4. Wait for feedback before starting work

### Adding New Components

#### Step 1: Create the Component

Create a new directory in `src/components/ui/`:

```bash
mkdir src/components/ui/my-component
touch src/components/ui/my-component/MyComponent.astro
```

**Component template:**

```astro
---
import { cn } from "@/utils/cn";
import type { HTMLAttributes } from "astro/types";

export interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<"div"> {
  variant?: "default" | "secondary";
}

const {
  variant = "default",
  class: className,
  ...props
} = Astro.props;

const baseStyles = "inline-flex items-center gap-2";

const variantStyles = {
  default: "bg-primary text-white",
  secondary: "bg-secondary text-gray-900",
};

const classes = cn(baseStyles, variantStyles[variant], className);
---

<div class={classes} {...props}>
  <slot />
</div>
```

#### Step 2: Add Component Metadata

Edit `scripts/generate-registry.ts` and add to `COMPONENT_META`:

```typescript
"my-component": {
  description: "Brief description of the component",
  category: "form", // or layout, navigation, feedback, disclosure, display
  registryDependencies: [], // Other components this depends on
},
```

#### Step 3: Generate Registry

```bash
npm run generate-registry
```

#### Step 4: Create Documentation

Create `src/content/components/my-component.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: MyComponent
description: A brief description of what this component does.
---

import MyComponent from "@/components/ui/my-component/MyComponent.astro";

## Overview

Describe what the component does and when to use it.

## Basic Usage

<MyComponent>Content here</MyComponent>

## Variants

<MyComponent variant="secondary">Content here</MyComponent>

## Props

- `variant` - The style variant (default, secondary)
- `class` - Additional CSS classes
```

#### Step 5: Test with CLI

```bash
# Test adding the component
BEARNIE_REGISTRY_PATH=./public/registry bearnie add my-component
```

#### Step 6: Commit and Create PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add MyComponent component"
git push origin feature/my-component
```

### Improving Documentation

1. Navigate to the relevant `.mdx` file in `src/content/components/`
2. Make improvements to examples, descriptions, or add new sections
3. Test locally with `npm run dev`
4. Create a pull request with your changes

### Fixing Bugs

1. Create a branch for the fix: `git checkout -b fix/bug-description`
2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Create a pull request with:
   - Clear description of the bug
   - Link to related issue
   - Steps to verify the fix

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest main:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

2. **Run tests and checks:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run cli:build
```

3. **Commit with meaningful messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for X"
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with Y"
git commit -m "docs: improve Z documentation"
```

Use conventional commits:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Build process, dependencies

4. **Create the pull request:**
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Link to any related issues
   - Request a review from maintainers

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Provide proper interfaces for props

### Astro Components

- Use `.astro` extension
- Export a `Props` interface
- Use semantic HTML
- Support the `class` prop for customization

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Support color theming via CSS variables
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels when needed
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
