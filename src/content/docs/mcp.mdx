<Prose>
The Bearnie MCP server connects your AI assistant directly to the component registry. Ask for components in plain language and they get added to your project automatically.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard supported by Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and other AI tools.

### Setup
</Prose>

<DocsTabs tabs={mcpClients} class="mt-6" />
</div>

<Prose>
### What your AI can do

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `list_components` | Show all available components by category |
| `search_components` | Find components by name or description |
| `get_component` | View source code and dependencies |
| `add_component` | Add component files to your project |

Components go to `src/components/bearnie/`, utilities to `src/utils/`.

For interactive components, the MCP flow also adds shared runtime files to `src/utils/runtime/` so behavior works out of the box with no extra setup.

If a component needs an npm package, you'll be told what to install.

### Example prompts

- "What form components does Bearnie have?"
- "Add the tabs and accordion components"
- "Show me how the dialog component works"
- "Build a settings page with cards and switches"
